# Code Generation

Code generation is the main way you can glue [Terramate data](../sharing-data.md)
to other tools, like Terraform.

Different code generation strategies will be provided in the future to support
each integration scenario in the best way possible. Currently, we support:

* [HCL generation](./generate-hcl.md)
* [File generation](./generate-file.md)
